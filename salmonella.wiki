=== The command line tool

==== Command line options



==== Log file format

The command line tool writes a log file which contains records in the
following format:

 (<egg> <action> <status> <message> <duration>)


===== <egg>

Can be either a symbol that indicates the egg-name or {{#f}} to
indicate the {{start}} and {{end}} actions (logged when salmonella is
started and when it finishes testing, respectively).

===== <action>

A symbol to indicate the action that was executed.  Can be one of the
following values:

* {{start}}: starting salmonella
* {{fetch}}: fetching egg
* {{install}}: installing egg
* {{test}}: testing egg
* {{end}}: salmonella has finished

===== <status>

A numeric value indicating the exit status of the executed action.
When the action is {{test}} and {{status}} is {{-1}}, it means that
the egg has no tests.


===== <message>

The output generated by the commands executed to perform {{<action>}}.
A string.


===== <duration>

The time (in seconds) that was taken to execute {{<action>}}.

For the {{start}} and {{end}} actions, the value is the seconds since
epoch, so the total salmonella execution time can be determined by
subtracting the start time from the end time.
