== Some quick tips by example

Simplest case: testing eggs using the remote egg server and the
chicken tools (chicken-install and csi) in the system PATH

  $ salmonella big-chicken slice


You can test all the available eggs using one of the following
approaches:

1. If you have CHICKEN >= 4.7.2:

  $ salmonella `chicken-install -list`


2. If you don't have CHICKEN >= 4.7.2:

  $ salmonella `wget http://code.call-cc.org/cgi-bin/henrietta.cgi?list=1 -q -O -`


If you don't want to test some specific eggs, you can skip them:

  $ salmonella --skip-eggs=macosx,hfs+ `chicken-install -list`


You can tell salmonella to use a specific CHICKEN version:

  $ salmonella --chicken-installation-prefix=/usr/local/chicken-4.7.3 big-chicken slice


Not cleaning the egg installation repository after installing each egg
may significantly speed up the salmonella execution time (the default
behavior is to set the egg installation repository empty after testing
each egg):

  $ salmonella --keep-repo big-chicken slice

warning: if you use --keep-repo, salmonella will not be able to catch
dependencies problems.


If you want to reuse the same egg installation repository for multiple
salmonella runs, you can provide a specific directory:

  $ salmonella --repo-dir=my-repo --keep-repo big-chicken slice


By default, salmonella generates a log file named `salmonella.log' in
the current directory.  You can change that by using the `--log-file'
command line option:

  $ salmonella --log-file=my-log-file.log big-chicken slice



== Using salmonella as an egg lint tool

Suppose you are working on a new egg and you want to check if it is
working ok before releasing it (or a new version).  You can use
salmonella to check it:

  $ cd my-egg    # where your egg code is stored
  $ salmonella --this-egg



== Viewing the results

Salmonella provides a very simple text-only log viewer:

  $ salmonella-log-viewer salmonella.log

Alternatively, you can use salmonella-html-report
(https://github.com/mario-goulart/salmonella-html-report) to generate
an HTML output (with [reverse] dependencies graphs and a lot more
information):

  $ salmonella-html-report --log-file=salmonella.log --out-dir=salmonella-report
  $ your-favorite-browser salmonella-report/index.html
